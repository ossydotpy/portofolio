    <!-- Look ma, no frameworks! -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Functionally Correct Website</h1>
    <p>How did you know I'm a backend developer? Was it the clean, semantic HTML or the lack of distracting visual elements?</p>
    
    <h2>Features (aka What I Understand):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pure, unadulterated HTML (The good stuff)</li>
        <li>Zero CSS Dependencies (Who needs 'em?)</li>
        <li>100% JavaScript-Free (No client-side bloat!)</li>
        <li>Runs Blazing Fast* (*on my machine, in ideal conditions)</li>
        <li>RESTful Principles Applied (Probably)</li>
        <li>Database Schema Not Included (It's a secret)</li>
        <li>Scalable Architecture (Just add more `<br>` tags)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr> <!-- This is like a horizontal rule, very technical. -->

    <h2>Error Handling:</h2>
    <p>If you see a 404, you typed the wrong URL. If you see a 500, just refresh. It's probably fine.</p>
    <!-- TODO: Implement actual logging someday -->

    <p>Contact me maybe? If the server is up?</p>

    <!-- My actual backend code has even fewer comments than this HTML -->

    <p>Okay, fine. The UI/UX expert (my cousin) said this needs "improvement". If you absolutely *must* see gradients and rounded corners:</p>

    Don't click it, it's probably full of JavaScript tracking pixels.
